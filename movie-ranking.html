<h1> The Best Movies According To Victor</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 Movies Of All-Time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Fight Club</h3>

<p>Arguably Edward Norton and Brad Pitt at their peak. Super interesting philosophy referenced throughout the film with shades of Buddhist and Stoic elements. </p>

<h3>Everything Everywhere All At Once</h3>

<p>Incredible visual effects and a super beautiful message behind the film -- that everything is a mess and no one actually knows what the hell is going on. But despite of all that, at least being kind to others is a great start.</p>

<h3>A Clockwork Orange</h3>

<p>This film was my first experience of Stanley Kubrick's work. It had a pretty powerful impact on me in my university days. The movie's soundtrack had a somehwat disturbing effect on the psyche and was rather subversive by overlaying upbeat music in violent scenes. I remember sitting mouth agape during the film's closing credits with 'Singing in the Rain' bombarding my conscience and humanity.</p>
